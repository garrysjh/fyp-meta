MAML Implementation on the Movielens dataset.

https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

For running locally on your machine without change to the code, download and move the ml-32m folder into /data/ directly and run 
`python data_preparation.py`
`python maml.py`
`python evaluation.py`

in that order.
